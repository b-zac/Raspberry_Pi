Hi !

If you are here, you are probably checking what did I actually do in here.

To make it easier for you, this folder contains all my code (or at least all the code I remember about).

The detect_video.py file is the file used to start the smart doorbell's system. It is original code coming from the owner of the repository.
I edited it slighly for the purpose of this project. I marked it using ############ comments, the start and end of my code.

Every other file apart from detect_video.py, came from me.

Thanks!
